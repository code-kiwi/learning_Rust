# Learning Rust

This repository contains my personal work while learning the Rust programming language.

I am mainly following the official book, **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}**, and experimenting with small examples and exercises along the way.

## Goals

- Learn Rust fundamentals (ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, traits, etc.)
- Practice idiomatic Rust through small programs
- Build a solid foundation before starting larger personal projects

## Structure

The repository will evolve progressively as I move through the book and explore additional topics.

## Notes

This is a learning-oriented repository:
- code may be experimental or incomplete
- focus is on understanding rather than production-ready solutions
